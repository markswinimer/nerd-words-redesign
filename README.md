Nerd Words is a random word library creation and sharing application.
It is designed to be used with games like Pictionary and Taboo.
You can create and find word libraries that can be used in place of physical card decks in the aforementioned games.

Nerd Words was initially created as part of a two week final project during my time at Launch Academy. I now endeavor to recreate the app with a more solid foundation and take my time to use best practices.
